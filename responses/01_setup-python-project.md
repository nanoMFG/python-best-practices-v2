## About The Project
This project will introduce basic skills for building up a Python project and good habits to follow while developing it.  A commonly used directory structure and its purpose will be presented along with a number of what we consider to be "best practices".

Of course, no practice can be considered "best" for every situation.  Many of the particular choices we make for this lab can be done differently just as well.  But we hope to present a concrete example with particular choices that we think are broadly useful for most small to medium Python applications.

This is intended to be a stepping stone for modest python applications away from monolithic single scripts, or cluttered notebooks and toward code that is more maintainable, easier to read, easier to test and install and ultimately easier for **others** to use and contribute to.

### Project Goals

* Create a working Python application that lives on GitHub.
* Develop primary functions within Python [module files](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) in a simple [package](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages).
* Use docstrings with a consistent style to document modules, classes and functions.
* Use code linting and formatting to maintain consistent styling.
* Add a basic [`setup.py`](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html) file enable `pip install`.
* Pin requirements and use a virtual environment with [pip tools]() and conda
* Develop code that passes tests using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org).
* Use continuous integration to enforce testing and formatting.
* Develop an application that uses our internal package to solve a classic machine learning problem.
