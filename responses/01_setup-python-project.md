<!-- LICENSE -->
## License

This is in the root directory and is where you should add a license for your project. In the repo you will have an option to add an MIT liscense. 
Distributed under the MIT License. See `LICENSE` for more information.

## requirements.txt
This is not mandatory, but if you use this, you put it in the root directory.

Here, you mention the modules and dependencies of the project- the things it will not run without.

In your repository, firstly create a License and a README. Then, create a new module directory and move the existing Python code to the directory. After you are finished, commit your changes to move on to the next step.

***NOTE: IF YOU COMMIT AN INVALID README/LISENCE FILE, WE WILL COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE AND PREVENT YOU FROM MOVING ON.

For testing purposes, write in your README file and actually make a LICENSE file with nanoMFG instead of your github username
