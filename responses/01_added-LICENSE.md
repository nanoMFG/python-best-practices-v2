...Moving right along!  

Now, one more preliminary bit of setup.  To help avoid accidentally committing unwanted files to your repository (such as files that are generated when the code is installed, tested, compiled or ran) adding a `.gitignore` file is both very helpful and yes, can even be considered a "best practice".  

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a .gitignore file
Check out the links below for more basic info on the `.gitignore` feature of git.
Setting up projects with a .gitignore is another chance to let GitHub to some heavy lifting for you
use the link below, or use the GitHub interface manually to begin the add file interface for a file named `.gitignore` file 
on this branch.  Similar to the LICENSE file, GitHub will recognize this special file name and open up a selection interface
from which you can select: (Python-of course).  

Take a minute to scroll through and see what file types are in there, the commit the file to this branch.  I'll see you in the next comment below
