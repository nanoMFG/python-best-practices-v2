Great! You figured out why the test was failing. Now, let's write some real tests for our application :)

### :keyboard: Activity: Writing new tests
We have provided 5 tests in total. 1 already implemented, 1 partially implemented and 2 left to be implemented by you.
  1. Take a look at ```test_x_shape``` and ```test_y_shape```. The two tests exist to check whether the training images, test images, training labels and training images were loaded. Because x is an image, there is an additional check for whether it is a square but for y, that is not necessary as y are just labels. Complete ```test_y_shape``` based on ```test_x_shape```.
