Great!
Looks like we have a README.md in the top level directory on this branch.  Let's move on to the LICENSE file.  

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a LICENSE file
Github is a great resource for adding license files.
Templates for most the most commonly used software licenses
are available via the web interface.  Go ahead and use the GitHub interface to add a file
named `LICENSE` to the top-level of this branch, then we'll move on to the next step.
