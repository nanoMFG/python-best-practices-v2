## Step 3: Review README.md and Merge Pull Request 

The `README.md` file is the homebase for a GitHub hosted project.  It is the most visible file for anyone
that visits your GitHUB repo.  A great `REAMDE.md` is a living document that can get new developers and users up to speed quickly and remind everyone what the heck is going on (including you :smirk:).

Using a template you like is a good best practice to follow when setting up a new project.  For this step, I did most of the work for you, by committing a README.md that is based on [a nice template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template).  Head over to the [files changed]({{files_changed_tab}}) tab 
in the PR or check out [the proposed REAMDE.md itself]({{readme_link}}) in this branch.

Using a good template like this one should serve most projects well, as a starting point, but feel free to make as many changes as you like and commit them to this branch before moving on.  Then, keep it around somewhere the next time you create a repo for a new project!
