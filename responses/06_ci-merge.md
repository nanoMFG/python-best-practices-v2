## Step 7: Pass Check Suites Before Merging Pull Requests

Throughout the course, we have many ways to know whether you are on the right track with the course. One of such tools are the check suites that are run every time you make a commit. At the end of each pull request, you are expected to pass the check suite to move on to the next step. In this pull request, we blocked you from merging the pull request before passing our check suites. 

#### DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THE `tests/course` DIRECTORY. ALL OUR CHECK SUITES WILL USE TESTS FROM THAT FOLDER.

This is how it'll be like when you are waiting for the check suites to complete.

You should have full green checks when you pass all the check suites.

You should see some red cross if you did not pass the check suite.

Usually, we recommend you check through our issues first and compare with what you did. However, if you are stuck, you can click details next to the failed check suite and then see the error messages.

#### If your course is being a bit buggy with check suites refresh a few times to get response from. Usually waiting out until you get either all green checks or some red crosses will do just fine.
