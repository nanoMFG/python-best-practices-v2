## Adding Our First Python PAckage
When starting out with a Python application, it is a good idea to anticipate what internal functions and classes will be created and have an idea how they might work together.  With a little planning you can start a project with some simple structure on which you can build out a set of packages and modules--the standard building blocks of a Python application.

Following these best practices will help you create organized, well-documented code that is easier to test, use, re-use and maintain.

While it is possible to complete this course using only the GitHub website, we recommend taking some time to setup a development environment on you local machine.  At a minimum this environment should enable you to do the following:  
1. Clone Git/Github repositories.
2. Maintain Python environments
3. Run Python applications

While it is outside the scope of this course to document the many possibilities for accomplishing this, we do offer some specific recommendations for using Anaconda + VSCode below. Click into the next section to read more about our recommendations for setting up a Python environment using Anaconda and VSCode.  If you already have a setup you like feel free to skip over this section.

### Setting up a Local Python Development Environment

Using a virtual environment that encapsulates the Python version and all of the required libraries (plus their versions) needed by your application is a standard best practice.  A virtual environment is from any system-wide python install.   Virtual environments are fairly easy to maintain and help developers both track dependencies and users avoid version collisions.

#### System Recommendations

Setting up a local development environment using either Windows, Mac OS or Linux will allow you to develop run and test applications locally before committing to your project repository.  We recommend trying the Anaconda Python distribution and the VSCode text editor. 

#### VSCode

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular open source text editor with many qualities of an IDE.  Text highlighting, auto-complete and many many other extensions make it a powerful development platform.  also included is an integrated terminal that can be used to run test maintain virtual environments and much more.

#### Anaconda

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is an open source Python distribution and package management system.  Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/) to install Anaconda to your system.

On a Mac, Linux or Windows WSL system with either Anaconda or miniconda installed, running the following command from the terminal will activate the default conda environment:
```
$ source ~/anaconda3/bin/activate
```
Usually if all went well you will see an indication that you have entered the "base" conda environment in `(base)` being prepended to you command prompt.
