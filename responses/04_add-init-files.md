# First Python files

The first actual python file we are going to add is an \_\_init\_\_.py. This file is what defines a module, and should be placed in the module directory.

### Directory Structure

The \_\_init\_\_.py needs to be placed in the directory that contains the rest of the module code. This will usually be the directory named like the module, i.e. if your module is named 'hello,' you would create the file src/hello/\_\_init\_\_.py.

## Step 4: Create an \_\_init\_\_.py

In our case, we need to create two \_\_init\_\_.py's, one for the 'digit_reader' package, and one for its internal 'model' package.

### :keyboard: Activity: Commit your \_\_init\_\_.py's

1. Commit a blank \_\_init\_\_.py for the 'digit_reader' module
2. Commit a blank \_\_init\_\_.py for the 'digit_reader/model' module
3. Open a pull request to main with your changes

**:bulb: [Add `src/digit_reader/__init__.py`]({{quicklink1}})**
**:bulb: [Add `src/digit_reader/model/__init__.py`]({{quicklink2}})**
