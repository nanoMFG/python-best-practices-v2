# Docstrings

Docstrings are a way to tell users how your code works, and how they should use it. It's a good idea to include them in everything you put on GitHub.

### Google style docstrings

In this course we will use Google style docstrings, a full description can be seen [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings). The simplest docstring looks like this:

        """
        A short one line summary of the function
        
        A longer paragraph description of the function, with details on implementation
        
        Args:
            foo: description of function argument 'foo'
            bar: description of function argument 'bar'
            
        Returns:
            foobar: description of 'foobar', what the function returns
        """
        
## Step 6: Add Docstrings

We'll start by adding docstrings to each of the methods of your 'model.py' file. Don't worry about the Args or Returns for now, just write the one line summary for each.

### :keyboard: Activity: Adding Docstrings to 'model.py'

2. Add a docstring to 'train_model()'
3. Add a docstring to 'evaluate_model()'

        Writing docstrings by yourself is fun, but can be time consuming. Many editors have support for automatically generating docstrings for a function, usually by either pressing a hotkey or typing '"""'. In VSCode, a widely used IDE, you can download <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring">this extension</a>, which has support for generating Google style docstrings. Try it out if you are using VSCode for this tutorial!
