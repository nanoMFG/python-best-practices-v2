3. Follow Style Guidelines
The PEP8 holds some great community-generated proposals.

PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposals- these are guidelines and standards for development. This is to make sure all Python code looks and feels the same.

One such guideline is to name classes with the CapWords convention.

Use proper naming conventions for variables, functions, methods, and more.
Variables, functions, methods, packages, modules: this_is_a_variable
Classes and exceptions: CapWords
Protected methods and internal functions: _single_leading_underscore
Private methods: __double_leading_underscore
Constants: CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES
Use 4 spaces for indentation. For more conventions, refer to PEP8.

Go to formatting.py and edit the code so that the style guidelines are followed. Then, commit your changes.

For testing purposes, make any commit that includes 'x = 5' in formatting.py
