The `README.md` is the homebase for the project.  It is the most visible file for anyone
that visits you GitHUB repo.  So, yes we believe it is a good best practice to make this
file into living document that can get new developers up to speed quickly and remind everyone what the 
heck is going on (including you).

For this activity, we did most of the work for you.  Click the link below to head over to a pull request where we
have commited a README file that is based on a template we like.  

### :keyboard: Activity: Review our README.md file
##### :bulb:[Go here]({{readmelink}}) 
Navigate to the pull request we opened where we can take a look at the README.md file and 
add the remaining preliminary files.  After that, we'll move on to the fun stuff, some live machine leaning code!
