### :keyboard: Activity: Add a LICENSE file
Github is a great resource for adding license files.
Templates for most the most commonly used software licenses
are available via the web interface.  Go ahead and use the GitHub interface to add a file
named `LICENSE` to the top-level of the project, or follow our quick link below.  
**:bulb: [Add a LICENSE]({{quicklink}})**  

Spend some time looking over the differnet templates and select one.  After that scroll down
and commit the change to a new branch and open a pull request:

Finally, click the "create pull request: button.  Once I detect the new pull request, I'll add a
comment there with the next activity.

##### :memo: Tip: 
Anytime you navigate away from this page to add files, consider opening a new tab to 
make it easier to find your way back to these instructions and the next step.  If you lose track
just navigate to the pull requests tab for the repo and re-open the most recent pull request.
