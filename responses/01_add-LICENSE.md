Great!
Looks like we have a README.md in the top level directory on this branch.  Let's move on to the LICENSE file.  

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a LICENSE file
Github is a great resource for adding license files.
Templates for most the most commonly used software licenses
are available via the web interface.  Go ahead and use the GitHub interface to add a file
named `LICENSE` to the top-level of this branch, then we'll move on to the next step.

Anytime you navigate away from this page to add files, consider opening a new tab to 
make it easier to find you way back to these instructions and the next step.  If you lose track
just navigate to the pull requests tab for the repo and re-open this PR.
