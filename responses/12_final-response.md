- Wrote and ran a test using pytest
- Implemented a very basic MNIST classifier

## Give us feedback

We'd love to hear what you thought of this course. Please share your feedback in [this brief survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/intro-to-github-1).

## What's next?

We hope that you will continue to follow the best practices when working on any Python projects from now on. We only covered the very basics so you can always go more in-depth into the different topics we introduced by checking official documentation :)

### Keep learning

Here are some suggestions for future courses you can take:
- [Continous Integration](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-actions:-continuous-integration): In this course, you probably saw how we ran checks to make sure that you were on tracks with our course using CI tools.
- [TensorFlow](https://lab.github.com/everydeveloper/advance-tensorflow): We used TensorFlow in this course very briefly just so your program would do something meaningful at the end. However, you can create much more complicated projects using TensorFlow!

Most important of all, try to work on some cool Python projects so you can get practice with everything you learn in your journey.
